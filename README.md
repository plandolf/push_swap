# Push_swap

## Introduction

The "Push_swap" project is a complex algorithm challenge focused on sorting data on a stack with a limited set of instructions, using the least number of moves. The primary goal is to learn about algorithm optimization and complexity, particularly under constraints similar to those found in real-world scenarios.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Sort numbers using two stacks (`a` and `b`) and a specific set of operations.
- **Algorithm Used**: Radix sort for efficient sorting.
- **Performance**: Achieved a score of 84/100 without completing any bonus tasks.

## Features

- **Efficient Sorting**: Implements Radix sort to handle sorting with a limited number of operations.
- **Complexity Management**: Focuses on optimizing the sorting process to reduce the total number of operations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GCC compiler
- Makefile for compilation

### Installation

1) git clone [repository-url] push_swap
2) cd push_swap
3) make all

## Usage

To run the program, pass a series of integers as arguments. The program will output a series of operations to sort these integers in ascending order on stack `a`.
